# Data-Visualisation--Heart-disease-dataset

This is my third Kaggle exploratory data analysis project and I am completely immersed in this work. This week, we are looking into the [heart dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/heart-disease) from Kaggle and the objective of this project is to look correlations between the attributes and heart diseases. According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases/#tab=tab_1), close to 17.5 million people lost their lives every year to cardiovascular diseases and heart disease is part of it. This dataset will prove useful for researchers to better understand the correlations between these risk factors and heart diseases, allowing for better medical interventions to those that are under high risk for this disease.
